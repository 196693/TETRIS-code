###### The following parameters are required:
# input_files: relative path of the input files, comma seperated.
# triangle_count: the actual number of triangles in each graph, the order must be same as the input_files.
# seed count: the number of seeds. Multiple options can be provided with comma seperated.
# sparsification_prob: Multiple options can be provided with comma seperated.
# subsample_prob: how many edges to sample from edges collected by random walks
# no_of_repeats: integer. Default value is 1.
# algo_names: Multiple options can be provided with comma seperated.
# print_to_console: default value true
# print_to_file: default value false
##### Some example graphs and their true triangle count:
# soc-flickr.edges = 58,771,288
# soc-flickr-und.edges = 548658705
# soc-friendster.edges = 4173724142
# soc-livejournal.edges = 83552703
# soc-orkut.edges = 524643952
# soc-sinaweibo.edges = 212977684
# soc-twitter-konect.edges = 34824916864
# socfb-A-anon.edges = 55606428
##### Algo_names
# Our algo: EstTriByRWandWghtedSampling
# Baseline:
# Sparsification based: EstTriBySparsification, EstTriByUniformSampling, EstTriByRW
# Sample edge and count based: EstTriByEdgeSampleAndCount, EstTriByRWAndCountPerEdge
# Neighbor sample: EstTriByRWandNborSampling
